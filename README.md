Mission Exploration Spatiale:
This project was realized for my lesson on python, in french.
Using Jupyter Notebook.
Context:
You are an astronaut on a mission to explore several planets. Each planet
contains valuable information, but you will need to solve puzzles to collect
resources and earn points. At each stage, you will need to use your Python skills
to solve challenges (loops, lists, dictionaries, etc.).
